      <h1>Advaya 2.0 (Day 6 & 7)- STEMathon</h1>
      <p class="text">
        Advaya 2021 ended with a contest of its kind: the STEMathon with the theme 17 UN SDGs. The participating teams had to explain their ideas along with naming the technologies used to implement their idea. It commenced with briefing the rules of ideation, video submission guidelines and the prizes. The judges wanted the idea to be realistic, technically feasible and to align with the 17 UN SDGs.

        <br>

        After submitting the pitch video, the participants had to pitch their idea and convince the judges. The 4 judges tested the viability of each pitch and marvelled at the good ones. Ten teams were selected by the judges for this one-to-one subsequent round. The average of scores of all the judges was used to make the decision of the top 3 winners.
